# KAFE Language

KAFE is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to facilitate learning Deep Learning concepts, functional programming structures, and symbolic processing. Created by 4 Computer Science and AI students from Universidad Sergio Arboleda.

## Core Purpose

Educational programming language that makes Deep Learning and functional programming concepts accessible through a simplified, Spanish-friendly syntax.

## Key Features

- Functional programming paradigm with lambda functions, currying, and higher-order functions
- Built-in libraries for scientific computing and deep learning:
  - `NUMK`: NumPy-like linear algebra library
  - `GESHA`: Neural networks and deep learning framework
  - `PLOT`: Matplotlib-like visualization
  - `MATH`: Mathematical utilities
  - `PARDOS`: CSV/DataFrame handling
  - `FILES`: File I/O operations
- Statically typed with type inference
- ANTLR-based parser with Python interpreter backend
- Web-based compiler interface available

## Language Philosophy

- Spanish-inspired keywords and naming (e.g., `mostrar` for show)
- Educational focus: clear error messages and intuitive syntax
- Functional-first but pragmatic (supports imperative constructs)
- Type safety without excessive verbosity
