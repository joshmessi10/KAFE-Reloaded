# Product Overview

KAFE is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for teaching Deep Learning concepts through a functional programming paradigm. Created by computer science and AI students at Universidad Sergio Arboleda.

## Core Purpose

Educational programming language that simplifies Deep Learning concepts by providing:

- Functional programming constructs (lambda, currying, higher-order functions)
- Built-in libraries for neural networks, linear algebra, and data visualization
- Spanish-language syntax and documentation for accessibility

## Target Users

Students and educators learning Deep Learning fundamentals without the complexity of production ML frameworks.

## Key Libraries

- **GESHA**: Neural networks and deep learning operations
- **NUMK**: NumPy-like linear algebra (arrays, matrices, operations)
- **PLOT**: Matplotlib-like visualization
- **PARDOS**: CSV/DataFrame operations (Pandas-like)
- **MATH**: Mathematical utilities
- **FILES**: File I/O operations

## Project Status

Active development - features are being refined and bugs are being fixed. Community contributions welcome.
